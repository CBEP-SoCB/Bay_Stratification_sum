# Introduction
Sonde "downcast" data generates a huge volume of data, which can be difficult 
to analyze or summarize. Consequently, the data is often presented largely in 
graphical form.  Formal statistical analyses are of less interest, as we
expect variation by depth, time, and location.

Here we focus on producing graphical summaries of the DEP sonde downcast data
from a transect from near the head of tide to the mouth of the Royal River
estuary.

We make use of a small graphics package we produced, `tdggraph`, that 
encapsulates logic needed to generate the necessary graphics.

#Load libraries

```

# Summary of Metadata
## QA/QC Samples
We conducted no analysis of QA/QC samples, and simply deleted then from the data
to avoid confusion.

## Censoring Flags
While preparing our working data, we separated raw observations from text
annotations, including data quality flags.  In the sonde-related data, we only
had to contend with (1) left censoring of turbidity data , and (2) data quality 
flags on all chlorophyll data.

Since all sonde-related chlorophyll data was flagged as of questionable accuracy
(with "J" flags), it does us no good to track that information during analysis.
We confirmed with DEP staff that the "J" flags reflect the fact that these are
sonde estimates of chlorophyll, based on observed florescence, which were never
recalibarated based on laboratory samples.

We also had a few "U<" (undetected) flags in the Turbidity data.  We separated out a 
`TRUE` / `FALSE` flag to indicated censored values, with the name 
'turbidity_cens`.

## Units
Our derived data files lack any indication of units.  Units were documented
in the source Excel files.  We summarize relevant information here.

# Make Data Subsets
# Royal River Transects
We filter to sites in the Royal River and Cousins River only.  We order sites in
upstream to downstream sequence along each river.  Royal River sites RR-19 and
RR-20 are close together, and quite near CR-44.  Any of these three sites could
be considered the "most marine" station in these series, but we use RR-20 as the
common "most marine" station, as it occurs at the confluence of the two rivers.

```{r}
rr_transect_sites  <- sonde_data %>%
  filter(grepl('RR', site) |grepl('CR', site)) %>%
  select(site, site_name) %>%
  unique() %>%
  pull(site)
cr_transect <- rr_transect_sites[c(1,4,2,3,9)]
rr_transect <- rr_transect_sites[c(5:9)]
rm(rr_transect_sites)

rr_data <- sonde_data %>%
  filter(site %in% rr_transect | site %in% cr_transect)
#rm(cr_transect, rr_transect)
```

# Royal River Transect
## Approximate upstream to downstream distances
We estimated distances between sampling in GIS locations so the graphics reflect
relative locatiosn of sampling points up and down the estuary.
```{r}
rr_dist_lookup <- tibble( site = c('RR-01', 'RR-06', 
                                   'RR-13', 'RR-19', 'RR-20'),
                          dist = c(0, 885, 2043, 3089, 3248))
```

## How often was each site sampled?
We make an assumption here that sampling on one day is related.
```{r}
tmp <- rr_data %>%
  filter(site %in% rr_transect) %>%
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(was_sampled = sum(! is.na(depth)) > 1,
            .groups = 'drop')
xtabs(~ year + site, addNA = TRUE, data = tmp)
```

So, DEP sampled some sites, including the most upstream and the most downstream
only in 2017.  Since our purpose here is largely to demonstrate ideas for
displaying these data, we focus principally on 2017.


We filter the Royal Rive data to 2017, and order sites in upstream to downstream
order.  We also add in the `dist` values that roughly indicate distance from the
most upstream sampling location.  Note that RR-19 and RR-20 are quite close.
RR20 is shallower, as it sits on the edge of the bar at the confluence of the
Royal and Cousins rivers.

```{r}
rr_trans <- rr_data %>%
  filter(site %in% rr_transect) %>%
  left_join(rr_dist_lookup, by = 'site') %>%
  rename(dates = dt) %>%
  filter(year == 2017) %>%
  mutate(site = factor(site, 
                       levels = c('RR-01', 'RR-06', 'RR-13',
                                  'RR-19', 'RR-20')),
         sitenum = as.numeric(site))   # Needed for aleternate plotting
```

## Maximum Depths, 2017
```{r}
rr_data %>%
  filter(year == 2017) %>%
  group_by(site) %>%
  summarize(maxdepth = max(depth, na.rm = TRUE))
```
