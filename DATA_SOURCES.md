# DEP Data
## dep_sonde_data.csv
This data file was developed by CBEP based on data from Maine's Department of 
Environmental Protection (DEP).

Data was derived from DEP's "EGAD" data system, and sent to CBEP as an Excel
File.  The data was sent to CBEP in part because of its implications for
nutrients in Casco Bay.  We conducted a detailed review and reorganization of
the data.  The original data file and R notebooks documenting the data review
and reorganization  are in the DEP_Nutrients
[repository](https://github.com/CBEP-SoCB-Details/DEP_Nutrients).
